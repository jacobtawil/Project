            <h3>Josh Hart, like Jayson Tatum, is out of the March Madness tournament. Hart plays for Villanova University, which was the number seed at the begining of the tournament, and was expected by many to win the tournament. Even though they have lost, Josh Hart still proves to be a player that should be taken seriously.</h3>
